# Best Neighborhood Project
## Project Description
The goal of this project was to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The metric we used to make this determination was the best neighborhood to babysit in using datasets from the WPRDC website. We considered factors such as signalized intersections, playgrounds, and air quality.
